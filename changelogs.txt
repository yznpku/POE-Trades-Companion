\\
--1.12.3--
	Changes:
	- Added more GUI scaling options (from 25% steps to 5% steps).
	
	Fixes:
	- Using the "Clipboard Item" to find rare maps would not work.
	This is because the random generated name and the map name are split on separate lines.
	Therefore, the in-game stash search does not allow to search for a literal string.
	- The Min/Max button width and height would not be scaling.
	- The "All trades request have been answered" would not be scaling on the Y axis.
//
\\
--1.12.2--
	Fixes:
	- A "new update available" notification would always appear on start.
	This bug was caused by the recent updating changes brought with 1.12.1.
//
\\
--1.12.1--
	Changes:
	- The "Clipboard item" function now use "l: x" and "y: +x%" instead of "level: x" and "quality: +x%" for gems.
	This was done to reduce the characters used in the search string.
	- When updating with the "Enable BETA" setting enabled", if the release on "stable" is "better", it will choose that one instead.
	
	Fixes:
	- Having the "Only show while in game" setting enabled, the tool would still show on certain windows (such as the desktop)
	- Some items could not be pasted into the in-game stash search.
	This was due to the in-game stash search having a limit of 50 characters.
	Any item past the length will have its name cut to fit.
//
\\
--1.12--
	Since 1.12.BETA_14:
	
	Features:
	- Added compatibility for the new poe.trade map whisper.
	Since poeapp is using the same whisper layout for maps, it is now also compatible.
	
	Changes:
	- Sending messages has been improved. Overall better and more reliable.
	If you still get the issue where your item's name is sent in the local chat instead of the actual message, please report.
	- In case putting an item in the clipboard fails, you should now receive a notification.
	
	Fixes:
	- Settings GUI, Appearance tab: Using a non-hex value for any of the colour settings would cause a crash upon redrawing the Trades GUI.
	- Upon having your buyer join your hideout, the clipboard content would be set to the item's name whereas it should only happen when switching tabs or using the "Clipboard" buttons.
	
	*********************	
	Since 1.11.3:
		TL;DR: Condensed patch notes:
		- New skinning system. It has been made much more accessible in case you'd like to make your own skin.
		www.github.com/lemasato/POE-Trades-Companion/wiki/Creating-Your-Skin
		
		The old "System" skin has been replaced with "White" and its "Dark Blue" night alternative.
		White (new): A combination of white/blue colours.
		Dark Blue (new): The "night" alternative of the White skin.
		Path of Exile: It has been updated and look much better than it used to.
		
		If you are not much into skinning, you may still customize the font type and colours from the Settings menu.
		
		- Ctrl+Shift+LeftClick hotkey, which makes trading currency much easier.
		If you would like more informations about how it works, simply search for "Ctrl+Shift+Left" here below.

		- The tab colour will now change to green if your buyer has entered your area and purple if you received a whisper since you last checked its "Other:" slot.
		You may even have a custom sound play when one of these events occurs.
		- Hall of Fame. Can be seen in the "About?" tray menu.
		- All types of PoeApp whispers are now compatible.
		- "Send Message + Minimize" has been added as an option for Custom Buttons.
		- Icons are now used in place of the big old "MINIMIZE" text.
		- Support for FR/DE/ES whispers.
		This refers to the "@De/Von/Desde" prefix, not the actual translated whispers from pathofexile.com/trade.
		I will sadly NOT be adding support for these translated whispers as they also translate the league name, which cannot be retrieved anywhere from the API.
		In my opinion, it's a bad design choice as even in-game "Abyss" stays "Abyss" for everyone and not "Бездна" or "Précurseurs".
		
	
	*********************
	Full patch notes. Some of these may not be relevant to the transition between 1.11.3 and 1.12 but the in-between _BETA releases.
	
	Features:
		- The Trades GUI has been greatly improved. See the link at the top.
		The "System" theme has been replaced with the new "White" theme.
		The PoE theme has also seen many visual changes, and has been adapted to the new Skinning system.
		- More customisation is available in the "Customization > Appearance" tab, in the Settings.
		- Leagues are now retrieved from the online API.
		- All type of whisper received from poeapp.com should now be working correctly.
		
		- Tabs notifications:
		When your buyer joins your area, the tab colour will turn to green. The colour will revert back to normal when the buyer leaves the area.
		When receiving another whisper from a buyer, the tab colour will turn to purple. The colour will revert back to normal when you acknowledged the whisper by hovering the "Other:" slot for that tab.
		These options cannot be disabled at the moment, but full 1.12 release will allow to do so as well as playing a custom sound.
		- Night theme: Dark Blue.
		
		- You can now choose to play a sound when a buyer joins your area.
		- Nine new sound effects have been added.
		- Currency names for the new shards and orbs (Used by the "My Stats" tray menu).
		
		- Send Message + Minimize action. This allows you to send a message, then put the GUI into its minimized state.
		- Minimize and Maximize icons are now used instead of the "MINIMIZE" text, on the Trades GUI.
		- The tool now makes use of the GitHub API to retrieve the latest stable and beta versions.

		- Ctrl+Shift+Left Click Hotkey.
		This hotkey allows trading currency much easier.
		To stay within the "One server action per macro" GGG policy, it only withdraw one stack of currency per press.
		Upon pressing the hotkey, it compares the currency under your cursor and the currency in the "Price" Slot (from the Trades GUI).
		When both currency correspond, it will then behave as either a "Ctrl+Click" or a "Shift+Click, Number, Enter", based on the total amount required.

		For example: The "Price" Slot shows "53" alteration. Alteration Orbs max stack count is 20.
		The first press will "Ctrl+Click", removing 20 alteration. 33 more alration required.
		The second press will "Ctrl+Click" again, removing 20 alteration. 13 more alteration required.
		The third and final press will "Shift+Click, Send 13, Press Enter". You will have 13 alteration on your cursor, that you can place in your inventory.
		Any further press on the hotkey will not do anything, allowing to safely remove just enough of the currency required.

		- Hall of Fame. A new tab, accessible from the "About?" tray menu.
		
		- Added support for FR/DE/ES whispers.
		- Tray menu now has icons.
		- Warning box when the user has too many fonts installed.
		Having over 720 fonts installed can cause major slowness with Trades Companion on Windows 10.
	
	Improvements:
		- On startup, the tool logs the content of the Preferences.ini, this would slow down the start time as it would write many lines to the logs file.
		Instead of writing each line for every individual setting, we now create a full "block" containing the settings, effectively writing to the file only once.
		- Reading the game logs has been improved.
		Instead of checking the file every 100ms, the timer is set at 400ms on startup.
		Upon receiving a trading whisper, the timer will be reduced to 200ms.
		When you haven't received a trading whisper for 5 minutes, the timer will increase to 400ms.
		When you haven't received a trading whisper for 1 hour, the timer will increase to 600ms.
		- Tray notifications no longer hangs the script during their animation.
		- (Un)Minimizing no longer hangs the scirpt during its animation. The animation speed has also been improved.
		- CPU usage has been reduced when spam-moving the mouse around inside the Trades GUI.

		- Tray notifications have been improved. Up to 5 notifications can appear at the same time.
		- Sending message should now be more reliable, as it makes use of the clipboard.
		This also fixes an issue where people could get kicked out of the game, due to the message being sent too fast after opening the chat.

		- Improved the reliability of the function used to send messages.
		- Overall (minor) improvements to the Path of Exile Skin.

		- The icons used in "Smaller Buttons" have been updated.
		- The GUIs used for "Replace PID" and "Multiple instances detected" have been replaced.
		This new GUI allows the user to find the desired instance much easier.
	
	Changes:
		- Fonts now need to be installed on your system for the Trades GUI to function correctly.
		All fonts inside the program's local font folder will automatically be installed, using FontReg.
		- Slight visual change to the tray notifications.

		- The About GUI now shows both current Beta and Stable version numbers.

		- The tray notifications position is now based on your start bar position. 10px above, and 10px from the right border of your monitor.
		- Minor changes to the Settings tab from the Settings GUI.

		- The uncompiled script now uses the icon file.
		- The Trades GUI title is now centered.
		- Removed "- Queued Trades: xx" when no trades are on queue.
		- The White Skin "Title (Active)" color has been changed to white (from black).

		- TradesGUI: When failing to create an ImageButton, the error messages will be shown after the TradesGUI is created.
		This change has been made so you do not have to click through dozen of message boxes anymore, in case an error happens.

	Fixes:
		- The "Overlay" mode would not function as intended.
		Overlay mode is used to dock the Trades GUI to the top right of your game's window.
		- When changing settings from the "Appearance" tab, a new fake trade request is created on the Trades GUI, to make previewing changes easier.
		This tab would no longer appear since 1.10. Additionally, stats from this tab will not be saved.
		
		- On start, when using the "Mode: Window", the Trades GUI would appear at the default position instead of the previously saved one.
		- When using the "Mode: Overlay", upon activating another window, the Trades GUI position would not be automatically adjusted.
		- When using a non-default Screen DPI, the Trades GUI background picture would not fill the entire size.
		- When using a non-default Screen DPI, the tray notifications would appear cut-off.
		- Auto Updater: When running the source code (.ahk), the POE Trades Companion.ahk file would get deleted upon updating using the internal updater.
		
		- Clipboard search with trading whispers from poe.trade containing a gem as item would not function as expected.
		- When using the "User Defined" preset, all settings would be reverted back to default upon next launch.
		- Some elements would appear offset when using a non-default scale multiplier: Time Slot, Minimize, Tabs.
		- The "Minimize" text could clip out of bound with specific font sizes.
		- Potentially fixed an issue where the tray icon would not appear (If you happend to encounter this issue, please report it!)
		
		- "Only show while in game" would not work as it should.
		- Upon reaching the initial tabs limit (25), the GUI would fail to allocate more tabs.
		- When using an hotkey bound to a "Custom Button", an error would be logged even if the hotkey succeeded.
		
		- Emptying a message slot would revert its content back to default on next launch.
		- On start, until a trading whisper would be received, a warning would be shown when trying to use an hotkey linked to a button.
		- A file using some weird characters could appear in the folder you are running the application from.
		If you happen to have this file, it can safely be deleted.
		The origin of this file was due to an invalid path to the local .ini file, which would result in the location defaulting to the tool's folder.
		Also, if in the future this issue re-appear, the file will be placed in the application's local folder instead (\My Documents\Autohotkey\POE Trades Companion\), in order to avoid any trouble.

		- When unable to reach api.pathofexile.com, we normally use pre-included league names. This would not work correctly.
		- Receiving a trading whisper would temporarily pause the function used to send in-game messages.
		- Possible fix: The tool could "pause" during sending messages under specific circonstancies.

		- Hovering a Trades Slot would cause the ToolTip to "flicker".
		- Non-English whisper would fail to be parsed.
		
		- "Custom Buttons" would not be correctly positioned when all "Smaller Buttons" are disabled.

What's new:
- The "Mark trade as completed?" feature has been added, and its setting renamed to "Save the trade infos into a file?"
You can find the file containing all logged trades in MyDocuments\AutoHotkey\POE Trades Companion\Trades_History.ini
- A new Hotkeys sub-tab: Special. These allows you to bind the following actions:
Choosing the next tab / Choosing the previous tab / Closing the current tab / Toggling the minimize state.
- Five new smaller buttons that have a specific action: Clipboard / Whisper To / Invite / Trade / Kick.
These buttons use a special font that contains symbols corresponding to the button's purpose.
Each can be linked to an hotkey via the new tab: Smaller Buttons.
- The /NoAdmin Command-Line Parameter can be used to skip admin elevation.
- You can now set the font's quality from the Appearance tab. This allows fixing the issue with the Fontin SmallCaps font, where some characters would appear cropped.

- The title on the main interface would not be vertically centered (OCD TRIGGERS). The same is true for the "MINIMIZE" text.

What's fixed:
- Receiving a whisper with the "Trade Notification" sound toggle disabled, but with the "Whisper Notification" sound toggle enabled would not play the "Whisper Notification" sound.
- An issue with the Path of Exile skin where hovering a Custom Button would not highlight the picture under specific conditions.
- Changing a Custom Button's name in the Settings would no longer live-update the button's name on the Settings GUI (since 1.9.5)
- When receiving a new trade whisper without additional message, the "Other:" slot is set as "-".
Upon receiving another whisper from the same buyer, when hovering the "Other:" slot to see the full list of messages, the "-" would be included to the messages list.
- Some characters on the Fontin SmallCaps font would appear cropped. This has been fixed with the new addition of the "Font Quality" setting.
- With the Font Size set to "Automatic", upon choosing a font from the Appearance tab, the size number would not be updated to its default value. This could cause confusion for the user.

\\
--1.9.9--
- Fix: Custom Buttons hotkeys would only work while the cursor was on the main interface.
- Potential Fix: On launch, under specific conditions, the main interface's position would be reverted to default (top-right).
//
\\
--1.9.8--
- Fix: Custom Buttons: Missing chat edit field.
- Fix: Hotkeys: Hotkey and text being saved as Advanced Hotkeys instead of regular hotkeys.
//
\\
--v1.9.7--
- Fix: Path of Exile Skin: An issue since 1.9.5 where the corresponding tab image would not disappear upon closure.
//
\\
--v1.9.6--

//
\\
--v1.9.5--
- Added support for poeapp whispers.
- Slight changes to the item name shown for gems, and the location for premium stash tabs. It's now generally easier to read.
- Improved the "Clipboard Item" function. Making use of quotes and search tags, it allows a more precise item search.
- The main interface's position is now also saved after moving the window. Previously, it would only save the position upon reloading or closing the tool from its tray menu. This fixes an issue where killing the process would not save the interface's position.
- Fix: Run as admin: The local files would be stored in the admin's My Documents folder instead of the current user's My Documents. This would prevent the tool from reading the chat key from the game's config file.
- Fix: System Theme: Font size, when on automatic mode, would not use the default system's font size.
- Potential Fix: The transparency/click-through/auto-unminimize settings would sometimes not work correctly for some users.
//
\\
--v1.9.4--
- Enabling the "Overlay" mode will reset the last registered position to the top right of the monitor. This fixes a behaviour where the main interface would be stuck offscreen.
- Messages are no longer sent if the chat key is invalid (thus opening random panels, using skills/flasks).
- Fix: Messages ending with a space would not take the space in consideration when sending it in-game. For this change to take place, you will be required to open then close  [Settings] tray menu after updating.
//
\\
--v1.9.3--
- Fix: Using an hotkey would bring up the "replace PID" prompt.
//
\\
--v1.9.1--
- Added the button action "Write Message". Allows you to write a single message without sending it.
- Fixed an issue where the tool would be unable to retrieve the game's key used to open the chat if the "My Documents" folder was not in the userprofile folder.
//
\\
--v1.9--
What's new:  
- POE Trades Helper becomes POE Trades Companion, and comes with a brand new icon.  
- Due to lots of changes in the settings file, your settings prior to 1.9 will be wiped.  
- A new customization tab has been added in the Settings: Appearance.  
- Command-line parameters. More about it can be found on the Wiki.  

Appearance tab:  
- Skin. The classic "System theme" has been re-introduced and improved.  
- Scaling. Make the main interface bigger or smaller (from 50% to 200%). Useful for 4K monitors.  
- Font. Use your own font, or one of the pre-included ones.  
- Colors. Change the text colors of the main interface.  

Buttons Actions tab:  
- Statistics: Mark a trade as completed. It currently has no effect, but will be enabled in a future update.  


What's changed:  
Main interface:  
- Right clicking the "X" button will allow you to close similar trades.  

Settings:  
- Your changes are now automatically saved and applied upon closing the window. The "Apply Settings" button has been removed.  
- The tab previously known as "TradesGUI" has been renamed to "Buttons Actions". It has also been reworked to be more intuitive.  
- The "Clipboard new items" setting has been removed. Having "Clipboard on tab switch" and "Focus newly created tabs" enabled serve the same purpose.

- Button Actions tab:   
- Any change made to the Trades GUI in this tab are instantly applied to the main interface. The "Preview" button has been removed.  
- The way messages are handled has been reworked. You can set up to three messages for a specific button. Also, the key used to open the chat no longer defaults to ENTER: It is now automatically the same key you have set in-game. For this reason, Basic and Advanced messages have been removed.  

About:  
- Only the changelogs are being shown, and the window has been made bigger.  
- The donating button has been re-introduced (ifeelbadaboutthis).  


What's fixed:  
- Several things about the main interface.  
- Clicking on "Switch to Basic/Advanced" in the hotkeys tab would not re-select the hotkeys tab after re-creating the Settings GUI.
//


\\

- Fix: TradesGUI: Receiving a new trade request after having reached the default pre-rendered tabs limit, then closing them all would show a blank tab.

\\
--v1.8--
What's new:  
- Brand new PoE themed skin!  
- TradesGUI: Receiving a whisper from someone who is on your trades queue will add that whisper to the Other section.  
- TradesGUI: Receiving multiple times the same poe.trade whisper from someone (therefore making an unwanted duplicate) will no longer add that trade to the queue.  
- TradesGUI: Upon closing a tab, if other tabs contain exactly the same infos (Item+Price+Location), you can choose to automatically close those tabs aswell.  
- TradesGUI: Hovering the content of a Buyer/Item/Price/Location/Other slot now shows a tooltip containing the full text. This is so the user can still see the full slot's content if the text is being cut.

What's fixed:  
- Quality gem of 10% or 20% now show up correctly, just like prior to version 1.7.4.  
- Clicking on a custom button with the "Close Tab" option while no POE instances were running would wrongfully close the currently active tab after a few seconds.

\\
--v1.7--
What's new:  
- The Trades GUI has been completely re-worked. It now has a brand new custom title bar and a new function that allows you to minimize the GUI! Additionally, the title will turn yellow while trades are on queue.  
- Trades GUI now has a new "Other:" section. It contains anything that could have been added before and after the trade message, allowing you to see if, for example, the buyer added his offer after the regular trade message.  
- Trades GUI can automatically minimize itself while no trade are on queue, and un-minimize itself upon receiving a new trade request. The respective settings can be found in the [Settings] tray menu.  
- Upon receiving a new trade message, the new tab can be automatically focused by enabling the "Focus newly created tabs" in the [Settings] tray menu.  
- The variable %lastWhisper% has been added for usage in the TradesGUI/Hotkeys tab. It corresponds to the last person who whispered you.

What's changed:  
- Trades GUI is no longer click-through by default. You can still change this behaviour by ticking the new "Click-through while inactive" checkbox in the [Settings] tray menu.  
- Upon closing a tab, the script no longer defaults back to the first tab.  
- Due to the Trades GUI being pre-loaded at the start of the script, any change to the Trades GUI via the TradesGUI tab in the [Settings] menu now require a reload of the script to be taken in count.  

What's fixed:  
- When the buyer added something after the trade message, the "Location:" section of the Trades GUI would pick it up.  
- The [Cycle Overlay] would sometimes require to be clicked twice before cycling to the next found instance.  
- After a game crash, the Trades GUI buttons would no longer work since they were linked to the old PID. Now, if the linked PID does not match a POE instance anymore, the user will be asked to select between the found matches.  
//


\\

What's changed:

- Messages should be sending a bit faster now.
- If for some reason the script is unable to activate the game's window upon clicking a TradesGUI button, a tray tip will appear to tell you about it.
	
What's fixed:

- The TradesGUI should no longer "run away" upon updating, when using a non-default Screen Fonts DPI.
//


\\

--v1.4--
What's new:
- You can now set the transparency of the Trades GUI by going into the [Settings] tray menu.
The lowest you can go is 30%, to make sure the window is still able to be seen.
- "Dock Mode" being removed, you can now cycle the Trades GUI between the game's window by using the new [Cycle Overlay] in the tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
- You can switch the Trades GUI between [Windowed] and [Overlay] by right clicking the tray icon and clicking on the according mode.
- If the logs file is deleted or characters/lines are being edited out, the script will restart the Logs Monitoring function to make sure it doesn't stall
(^ This kind of behaviour should not happend, I consider it as an useless measure of security but I like it "just incase")
		
What's changed:
- You do not need to reload the script after changing a setting anymore, everything is instantly applied.
- "Dock Mode" and "Logs Mode" have been removed from the [Settings] menu, as it is all automatized now.
- The Trades GUI buttons now use a much faster method of sending keyboard input.
	
What's fixed:
- Tray icons from previously replaced instances of the script will now correctly disappear if they are not hidden in the sub tray notitication.
- The script will no longer skip whispers when receving two messages at the very same time.
- The Trades GUI will no longer flicker while having the "Show in game only" setting activated.
- Enabling an hotkey without binding it to a key prior will not crash the script anymore.
- You should no longer randomly receive a tray notification of a prior whisper.
	
Troubleshooting:
- About Logs Mode and Dock Mode being removed due to automatisation:
	Logs Mode:
	- If the script detect multiple instance of the game, it will check the location of the logs file.
	- If the logs file are located in different folders, it will show a new GUI to ask which one should be used.
	This only happens once at the very start of the Logs Monitoring function. So if you run a separate instance that doesn't use the same logs file while the script is already loaded, and want to monitor that log instead, you will need to reload the script.
	
	Dock Mode:
	- You can still define the window the Trades GUI will dock on by using the new [Cycle Overlay] tray option (Right click on the tray icon > Cycle Overlay)
	
- About the new Windowed and the Overlay mode:
	Windowed:
	- In Windowed mode, you can drag around the Trades GUI. If you want to move it while it's inactive (= click-through), simply open the [Settings].
	- Having the Settings window open allows you to drag the Trades GUI even if it's inactive. Closing the Settings will effectively re-apply the click-through ability.
	Overlay:
	- In Overlay mode, the Trades GUI will appear borderless and will dock on the top right of your game's window.
	- If you are running multiple instance and the Trades GUI is docked on the wrong window, use the new [Cycle Overlay] accessible by right-clicking the tray icon.

Feel free to enable it by going into the [Settings] tray menu.
