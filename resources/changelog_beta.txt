1.13.BETA_8 (31 Aug 2018)
	Features:
	- You can now update automatically the script using the .ahk version.
	
	Changes:
	- The clipboard is no longer reverted after being used for sending a message in-game.
	This change is due to an issue where some messages would send the wrong content.
	This change also fixes a behaviour where, while using TradeMacro, if you had an item data in the clipboard before using a custom button, the TradeMacro item data tooltip would appear (due to TradeMacro noticing the clipboard change).
	- 
	
	Fixes:
	- The StackClick hotkey wouldn't be able to function.
	This hotkey allows to take just the right amount of currency when doing a currency.poe.trade by using Ctrl+Shift+Click.
	- Stash Highlight: The tab name and the grid borders wouldn't be clickthrough.
	- When launching a new instance without any special parameter, would be unable to close the previous script instance.
	- Wouldn't be able to sort by clicking columns on the Stats GUI.
	- Using the "Close other tabs with similar items" feature, tabs style wouldn't be reset.
	This means that if a tab had the green or purple colour and was removed by the feature, any new tab with that ID would have appeared with the same colours scheme instead of the default one.

1.13.BETA_6 (24 Aug 2018)

	PSA: If you are missing your settings after updating, please copy the following files from the Admin account's MyDocuments to your user account's MyDocuments
	Folder : "\Documents\lemasato\POE Trades Companion" - Files: "Preferences.ini", "Trades_History.ini"
	
	Features:
	- "Show item location grid" has been added as a new action for buttons/hotkeys.
	This new feature allows to quickly find your item in your stash by highlighting its location on your screen.
	Two white squares will appear. The bigger is for normal stash tabs, and the smaller one is for quad stash tabs.
	It will also show the tab name the item is located in, so you don't have to look away.
	The grid will automatically hide itself when the game window is not on focus.
	- Any custom button that had the "Invite buyer to party" action has been updated with the new "Show item location grid" action.
	- The small "trade" button has been updated to show the item grid as well.
	- /InstanceName="" cmd line parameter.
	This new parameter merges both /NewInstance and the old /PrefsFile paramter together.
	It allows to run a second instance of the script, and keep your settings separate.
	The settings file will be renamed based on the instance name chosen.
	- Only receive PushBullet notifications while AFK.
	This setting was already existing previously but wasn't implemented until now.

	- Added a button to preview your changes in the Setting skins
	- Added a warning when trying to Price Verify unpriced items (not added yet).
	
	Fixes:
	- After reloading as admin, the admin's MyDocuments folder would be used instead of the user who started the executable's MyDocuments.

	Folder : "\Documents\lemasato\POE Trades Companion" - Files: "Preferences.ini", "Trades_History.ini"
	- Wouldn't be able to check prices for racing leagues.
	- The league from trading whispers from event leagues would show as "Incursion" instead of the full race name (eg. Incursion Event (IRE001)).
	- /GameFolder="" cmd line parameter not being detected.
	- Pushbullet notifications wouldn't work normally.
	- The script would slow down a bit upon receiving a trading whisper due to it always trying to send a PushBullet request.
	- Items containing a number (such as gems and maps) would be detected as currency item when trying to verify their price.
	- Clicking on a tab Other's slot would disable the "Purple" tab colour for all tabs of that buyer, instead of just that one tab.
	- If a tab had a "purple" colour, it wouldn't be restored upon recreating the Trades GUI (such as after closing the Settings)
	- The .ahk source would be unable to extract resources due to a change brought in 1.13.BETA_4/5
	- Incorrect GUI height with no small/special buttons enabled.
